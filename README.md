# Elura Waitlist

Elura helps beauty artists stop chasing clients and start getting booked.

This project is the early-access waitlist experience for artists who want a cleaner, more professional way to get discovered and booked.

## What Elura Is
Elura is designed for beauty professionals who want:
- A premium portfolio presence
- More consistent direct bookings
- Better trust with clients
- Less dependence on chaotic DM workflows

## Why Join Early
Waitlist members get first access as features roll out.

Early access is focused on artists who are serious about:
- Presenting their work professionally
- Growing booking quality, not just volume
- Building a long-term, premium personal brand

## Who It’s For
- Makeup artists
- Beauty service professionals
- Artists currently booking mostly through social platforms and referrals

## Waitlist Flow

- Email
- Optional Instagram handle

After submission, they are added to the early-access list and contacted when access opens.
